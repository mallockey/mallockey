# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Josh

I'm a **Software Engineer** based in the NYC area. 

I enjoys building things and learning deeply about how they work.  
Right now, I'm especially interested in **low-level concepts** and **computer architecture** â€” from how bits move through logic gates to how processors execute instructions.
